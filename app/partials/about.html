            <h2>Foundation Carved in Stone</h2>
            <p><strong>Erica Vhay</strong> was born into a family of architects and artists. Her great grandfather
              Gutzon Borglum and his son Lincoln Borglum - were famous for their <strong>sculpting of Mt.
                Rushmore</strong> and many other works of art.</p>

            <h2>Art in the Heart</h2>
            <p>Erica received a degree in <strong>Ceramics</strong> from the University of Oregon. She spent much of her
              education in art classes, emphasizing <strong>ceramics, sculpture and drawing</strong>. She opened her own
              studio after graduating in 1993, producing sculpture and functional pottery for two years in Eugene.</p>

            <h2>Designer Looking for More...</h2>
            <p>Erica moved to Boulder, CO and took up <strong>graphic design</strong>, working on industrial graphic
              design for music CDs and product packaging. While living in Boulder, she married a great guy who had
              followed her from Eugene. It was also during this time she took up drawing in earnest - working primarily
              with pastels. In 1999 she moved to a remote ranch in Montana, an elk hoof's throw from the Yellowstone
              river. She continued <strong>sketching and began painting</strong> - taking classes at Montana State
              University. </p>

            <h2>New Faces</h2>
            <p>From there she moved to the Phoenix area and produced two fine works that are still in progress -
              <strong>Miles Lincoln Brown</strong>, born 2001, and <strong>Leopold Ivan Brown</strong>, born 2003.
              Though the sculpting of these two works impacted her productivity for several years, she excelled as a
              <strong>web designer</strong>. </p>

            <h2>Getting Settled -- Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Erica and family moved to <strong>Flagstaff, AZ</strong> in 2006. Erica focused on <strong>oil
              painting</strong> from this time forward.
              Her subject matter is in constant rotation - with frequent portraits, landscapes, and foods.
              The scale of her paintings is also highly variable - ranging from 6"x6" to 60"x60".
              She currently shows work at <a href="/portfolio/gallery/galleries">several venues</a>.
